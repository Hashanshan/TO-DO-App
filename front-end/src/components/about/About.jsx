        <p>
        Welcome to my development world! I'm Hashan, a seasoned full stack developer with a diverse 
        skill set spanning React Native Expo, MySQL, Firebase, HTML, CSS, MERN stack, and PHP. 
        My journey in the tech realm has been marked by passion, innovation, and a commitment to 
        crafting solutions that make a real impact.
        <br />

        In my development arsenal, React Native Expo has been a game-changer, enabling me to 
        create cross-platform mobile applications seamlessly. I've also delved into MySQL, 
        crafting robust database structures that ensure data integrity and efficient retrieval. 
        Firebase is another tool in my kit, allowing me to build real-time, scalable applications 
        with ease.

        <br />

        One of my noteworthy projects is an e-vehicle sales website, a testament to my proficiency 
        in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. This comprehensive web application facilitates 
        seamless transactions and user-friendly experiences for buyers and sellers in the electric
         vehicle market.
         <br />

        Currently, I'm immersed in the ongoing development of "Blood-Guru," a project aimed at 
        revolutionizing blood donation through a React Native Expo framework. Leveraging the power of 
        Firebase, the app ensures real-time communication and data management, fostering a connected 
        community of blood donors and recipients.
        <br />

        In addition, I've recently ventured into the MERN stack, an experience that has been 
        nothing short of awesome. I developed a Todo app using this technology stack, embracing 
        the power of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to create a smooth and efficient 
        task management system.

        <br />

        Collaboration and innovation drive my work. If you're seeking a developer who can bring your 
        ideas to life, optimize your web presence, or contribute to cutting-edge projects, let's connect. 
        My journey in tech is marked by a passion for creating meaningful solutions, and I look forward to 
        the opportunity to bring that passion to your project.

        Feel free to reach out to discuss collaborations, projects, 
        or to delve into the exciting world of MERN stack development. Together, let's turn concepts
         into code and make a lasting impact in the digital landscape!
